<h1>Pitch</h1>

<p>The goal of my project is to visualize the unprecedented rise in home runs in Major League Baseball over the past two and a half seasons. </p>

<h2>Context: </h2>

<p>Through the decades, there have been persistent ebbs and flows in the amount of home runs hit across Major League Baseball. In several instances, steep rises in the amount of scoring have given way to conspiracies about physical changes to game ball itself. Most famously, a rise in scoring during the early 1920s was attributed to a “lively” new ball. Though the theory was subsequently debunked, the era retains its historical nickname: “the live-ball era.” </p>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16swdJIvmtPCNiF7lkUxGhQvvT9ZcHhZTPDfCZmosjRU/edit?usp=sharing">Here’s a graph.</a></p>

<p>The most famous rise in home runs was during the 1990s and early naughts, when the league’s 38-year-old home run record (61 home runs) was shattered by not just one, but three different players—Mark McGwire (70), Sammy Sosa (66), and then Barry Bonds (73). That home run spike, however, was later attributed to the widespread use anabolic steroids throughout the league, a shameful development that steeped the game in unwanted controversy. </p>

<p>After the “Steroid Era,” stricter drug testing regulations, defense-oriented analytic developments and increased pitch velocity sent scoring into a spiral. 2010 was eventually dubbed the “Year of the Pitcher” because of its dominant pitching performances. In 2014, scoring reached a modern low and discussions about changing the rules to benefit offense bubbled up. The new MLB commissioner, Rob Manfred, publicly considered eliminating certain analytically driven defensive strategies, or lowering the pitching mound. But no change was ever announced. </p>

<p>Suddenly, in the middle of the 2015 season, there was a dramatic rise in home runs. Moreover, new tracking technology, called Statcast, revealed that the baseball’s exit velocity — the speed at which the ball leaves the bat the bat —spiked as well. The trend didn’t stop there. Just last week, the all-time record for home runs in a season was set, with two weeks left in regular season play. Physicists and amateur baseball scientists have studied the issue closely and believe that the sudden change is largely tied to one variable: the ball. </p>

<p>The <strong>goal</strong> of the project is to visualize how the unprecedented rise in home runs by look at changes in the ball, the players and, to some extent, environmental changes—like climate and ballpark size. </p>

<p>For the ball, I will look at how the MLB’s ball regulations are so imprecise as to allow for a change in up to 50 ft in carry distance from ball to ball. I want to show how small changes in the ball can result in vastly different outcomes</p>

<p>For players, I want to use new “exit velocity” and “launch angle” data to show how ballplayers are manipulating their swings to hit the ball at very specific trajectories to maximize home run output.</p>

<p>The environment is more complicated. Will report back. </p>

<h2>Data </h2>

<p>I plan to use historical data from <a href="www.fangraphs.com">fangraphs.com</a> as well as <a href="www.baseballreference.com">baseballreference.com</a>. Exit velocity and launch angle data are available from several sources, including <a href="www.baseballsavant.com">baseballsavant.com</a>.</p>

<h2>How to Visualize</h2>

<p>— Area chart: I want to use an area chart to show the difference in distribution of home runs now versus the “Steroid Era.” One of the most fascinating pieces of the data is how home runs are more evenly distributed than ever. There’s a been a democratization of home run output. </p>

<p>— Animation: I think it would be helpful to animate a GIF showing how launch angle shifts can result in more runs. My vision is to have a Vitruvian man-style chart, in baseball wear of course, that animates changes in the launch angles of specific players. </p>

<p>— Line chart/scatter plot: Using a basic plot, I could show the relationship between the rise in exit velocity and the rise in home runs. </p>
